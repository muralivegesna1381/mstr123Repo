# Wearables mobile app
A mobile app using React Native along with iOS and Android native platforms for connecting/configuring sensors and managing pet/parent profiles.
#

## Description

The Wearables Clinical Trial (WCT) App owned by the Hillâ€™s Pet Nutrition aims to make nutrition a linchpin of veterinary medicine. Pet parents must sign up to WCT App to record their pet behaviors and become eligible to receive a nutrition related experimental study with a customizable diet and evaluate its effects.
Â 
WCT App is a great tool for pet parents to record their pet activities using Hills approved digital sensor technology. It's a tracking sensor applied on the neck of your pet that connects to the WCT app (compatible on IOS and Android).Â 

Sync the WCT App installed in your mobile with the senor provided by the Hills pet nutrition seamlessly using Bluetooth. The paired phone must be near the sensor and connected to registered Wi-Fi to capture and upload data to the cloud.

Detailed interactive app walkthrough available with instructions on every page of the app that really speak to pet parents onÂ 

How a pet parent can manage their account credentials.
Sensor Set up completed Dashboard when the sensor set up is completed generates a dashboard contains elements of basic components which provides a high-level overview of the various activities on the app to allow the user to monitor and access critical information associated with theirÂ pet behaviour, health, and other details.
